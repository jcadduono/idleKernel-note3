	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 430973 Cortex-A8
	  (r1p0..r1p2) erratum. If a code sequence containing an ARM/Thumb
	  interworking branch is replaced with another code sequence at the
	  same virtual address, whether due to self-modifying code or virtual
	  to physical address re-mapping, Cortex-A8 does not recover from the
	  stale interworking branch prediction. This results in Cortex-A8
	  executing the new code sequence in the incorrect ARM or Thumb state.
	  The workaround enables the BTB/BTAC operations by setting ACTLR.IBE
	  and also flushes the branch target cache at every context switch.
	  Note that setting specific bits in the ACTLR register may not be
	  available in non-secure mode.

config ARM_ERRATA_458693

	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 458693 Cortex-A8 (r2p0)
	  erratum. For very specific sequences of memory operations, it is
	  possible for a hazard condition intended for a cache line to instead
	  be incorrectly associated with a different cache line. This false
	  hazard might then cause a processor deadlock. The workaround enables
	  the L1 caching of the NEON accesses and disables the PLD instruction
	  in the ACTLR register. Note that setting specific bits in the ACTLR
	  register may not be available in non-secure mode.

config ARM_ERRATA_460075
	bool "ARM errata: Data written to the L2 cache can be overwritten with stale data"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 460075 Cortex-A8 (r2p0)
	  erratum. Any asynchronous access to the L2 cache may encounter a
	  situation in which recent store transactions to the L2 cache are lost
	  and overwritten with stale memory contents from external memory. The
	  workaround disables the write-allocate mode for the L2 cache via the
	  ACTLR register. Note that setting specific bits in the ACTLR register
	  may not be available in non-secure mode.

config ARM_ERRATA_742230
	bool "ARM errata: DMB operation may be faulty"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 742230 Cortex-A9
	  (r1p0..r2p2) erratum. Under rare circumstances, a DMB instruction
	  between two write operations may not ensure the correct visibility
	  ordering of the two writes. This workaround sets a specific bit in
	  the diagnostic register of the Cortex-A9 which causes the DMB
	  instruction to behave as a DSB, ensuring the correct behaviour of
	  the two writes.

config ARM_ERRATA_742231
	bool "ARM errata: Incorrect hazard handling in the SCU may lead to data corruption"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 742231 Cortex-A9
	  (r2p0..r2p2) erratum. Under certain conditions, specific to the
	  Cortex-A9 MPCore micro-architecture, two CPUs working in SMP mode,
	  accessing some data located in the same cache line, may get corrupted
	  data due to bad handling of the address hazard when the line gets
	  replaced from one of the CPUs at the same time as another CPU is
	  accessing it. This workaround sets specific bits in the diagnostic
	  register of the Cortex-A9 which reduces the linefill issuing
	  capabilities of the processor.

config PL310_ERRATA_588369
	bool "PL310 errata: Clean & Invalidate maintenance operations do not invalidate clean lines"
	depends on CACHE_L2X0

	   The PL310 L2 cache controller implements three types of Clean &
	   Invalidate maintenance operations: by Physical Address
	   (offset 0x7F0), by Index/Way (0x7F8) and by Way (0x7FC).
	   They are architecturally defined to behave as the execution of a
	   clean operation followed immediately by an invalidate operation,
	   both performing to the same memory location. This functionality
	   is not correctly implemented in PL310 as clean lines are not
	   invalidated as a result of these operations.

config ARM_ERRATA_720789
	bool "ARM errata: TLBIASIDIS and TLBIMVAIS operations can broadcast a faulty ASID"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 720789 Cortex-A9 (prior to
	  r2p0) erratum. A faulty ASID can be sent to the other CPUs for the
	  broadcasted CP15 TLB maintenance operations TLBIASIDIS and TLBIMVAIS.
	  As a consequence of this erratum, some TLB entries which should be
	  invalidated are not, resulting in an incoherency in the system page
	  tables. The workaround changes the TLB flushing routines to invalidate
	  entries regardless of the ASID.

config PL310_ERRATA_727915
	bool "PL310 errata: Background Clean & Invalidate by Way operation can cause data corruption"
	depends on CACHE_L2X0
	help
	  PL310 implements the Clean & Invalidate by Way L2 cache maintenance
	  operation (offset 0x7FC). This operation runs in background so that
	  PL310 can handle normal accesses while it is in progress. Under very
	  rare circumstances, due to this erratum, write data can be lost when
	  PL310 treats a cacheable write transaction during a Clean &
	  Invalidate by Way operation.

config ARM_ERRATA_743622
	bool "ARM errata: Faulty hazard checking in the Store Buffer may lead to data corruption"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 743622 Cortex-A9
	  (r2p*) erratum. Under very rare conditions, a faulty
	  optimisation in the Cortex-A9 Store Buffer may lead to data
	  corruption. This workaround sets a specific bit in the diagnostic
	  register of the Cortex-A9 which disables the Store Buffer
	  optimisation, preventing the defect from occurring. This has no
	  visible impact on the overall performance or power consumption of the
	  processor.

config ARM_ERRATA_751472
	bool "ARM errata: Interrupted ICIALLUIS may prevent completion of broadcasted operation"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 751472 Cortex-A9 (prior
	  to r3p0) erratum. An interrupted ICIALLUIS operation may prevent the
	  completion of a following broadcasted operation if the second
	  operation is received by a CPU before the ICIALLUIS has completed,
	  potentially leading to corrupted entries in the cache or TLB.

config PL310_ERRATA_753970
	bool "PL310 errata: cache sync operation may be faulty"
	depends on CACHE_PL310
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 753970 PL310 (r3p0) erratum.

	  Under some condition the effect of cache sync operation on
	  the store buffer still remains when the operation completes.
	  This means that the store buffer is always asked to drain and
	  this prevents it from merging any further writes. The workaround
	  is to replace the normal offset of cache sync operation (0x730)
	  by another offset targeting an unmapped PL310 register 0x740.
	  This has the same effect as the cache sync operation: store buffer
	  drain and waiting for all buffers empty.

config ARM_ERRATA_754322
	bool "ARM errata: possible faulty MMU translations following an ASID switch"
	depends on CPU_V7
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 754322 Cortex-A9 (r2p*,
	  r3p*) erratum. A speculative memory access may cause a page table walk
	  which starts prior to an ASID switch but completes afterwards. This
	  can populate the micro-TLB with a stale entry which may be hit with
	  the new ASID. This workaround places two dsb instructions in the mm
	  switching code so that no page table walks can cross the ASID switch.

config ARM_ERRATA_754327
	bool "ARM errata: no automatic Store Buffer drain"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for the 754327 Cortex-A9 (prior to
	  r2p0) erratum. The Store Buffer does not have any automatic draining
	  mechanism and therefore a livelock may occur if an external agent
	  continuously polls a memory location waiting to observe an update.
	  This workaround defines cpu_relax() as smp_mb(), preventing correctly
	  written polling loops from denying visibility of updates to memory.

config ARM_ERRATA_764369
	bool "ARM errata: Data cache line maintenance operation by MVA may not succeed"
	depends on CPU_V7 && SMP
	help
	  This option enables the workaround for erratum 764369
	  affecting Cortex-A9 MPCore with two or more processors (all
	  current revisions). Under certain timing circumstances, a data
	  cache line maintenance operation by MVA targeting an Inner
	  Shareable memory region may fail to proceed up to either the
	  Point of Coherency or to the Point of Unification of the
	  system. This workaround adds a DSB instruction before the
	  relevant cache maintenance functions and sets a specific bit
	  in the diagnostic control register of the SCU.

config PL310_ERRATA_769419
	bool "PL310 errata: no automatic Store Buffer drain"
	depends on CACHE_L2X0
	help
	  On revisions of the PL310 prior to r3p2, the Store Buffer does
	  not automatically drain. This can cause normal, non-cacheable
	  writes to be retained when the memory system is idle, leading
	  to suboptimal I/O performance for drivers using coherent DMA.
	  This option adds a write barrier to the cpu_idle loop so that,
	  on systems with an outer cache, the store buffer is drained
	  explicitly.

	  Various binutils versions can resolve Thumb-2 branches to

	  This is a problem, because there's no guarantee the final

	  kernel does not support fixing up the R_ARM_THM_JUMP11 (102)

	  support.

	  The symptom is that the kernel fails with an "unsupported

	  Until fixed tools are available, passing
